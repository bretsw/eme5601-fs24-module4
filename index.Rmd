# `r fa("fas fa-person-circle-question", fill = "#fff")` Needs Assessment Purpose

**Clear from the start:** What is the purpose of the needs assessment?

```

---

# `r fa("fas fa-person-circle-question", fill = "#fff")` Needs Assessment Purpose

Needs assessment is the **first step** in an iterative design cycle:

# `r fa("fas fa-person-circle-question", fill = "#fff")` Vocabulary of Needs

--

- **Need:** performance gap

--

- **Needs Assessment:** strategic level, tactical level (day-to-day operations), operational level

--

- **Needs Analysis:** underlying causes

--

- **Training Requirements Analysis:** If you know that training is the solution, why do a needs assessment? Which training is necessary? (p. 26)

--

- **Needs Assessment Planning:** comprehensive or situation-specific

--

- **Alignment:** between training assets and business goals

--

- **Position Road Map:** audiences you serve, tasks they perform, outcomes of their jobs, desired behaviors, job constraints

--

- **Needs Assessment Plan:** (like a research plan) objectives, target audience, sampling, data collection, instruments and protocols, data analysis, how decisions will be made based on the data

---

# `r fa("fas fa-person-circle-question", fill = "#fff")` Needs Assessment Steps

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/4-assessing-needs.png")
```

--

1. Establishing objectives

--

2. Identifying the target audience: Whose instructional needs are to be addressed?

--

3. Specifying instruments and protocols

--

4. Assessing the feasibility of the needs assessment plan

---

### This might be the most important slide of Module 4!

--

1. What are needs this project is attempting to satisfy?

--

2. What data or information will I need to clarify these needs?

--

3. How will I need to analyze this data to arrive at a reliable and valid conclusion?

--

### Key questions: 

--

- Based on what is known about the organization, how many of these characteristics relate to the present assignment?

--

- How are the characteristics relevant? What is known about how each characteristic effects on-the-job performance?

--

- How should information about these characteristics subsequently be used in the instructional design process to improve the chances that learners will apply on the job what they learned during instruction? 

--

- How should this information influence subsequent steps in the instructional design model?
